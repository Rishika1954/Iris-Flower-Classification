![iris flower](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5db526b1-405a-4379-9ce1-ee713ba47e2c)

# Introduction:-
The Iris flower dataset consists of three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. These species can be distinguished based on their sepal and petal measurements. Our objective is to train a machine learning model that can learn from these measurements and accurately classify the Iris flowers into their respective species. This dataset is widely used for introductory classification tasks.

# Dataset:-
The Iris dataset includes 150 observations with the following attributes:

1. Sepal length in cm
2. Sepal width in cm
3. Petal length in cm
4. Petal width in cm
5. Species (setosa, versicolor, virginica)
The dataset file used in this project is IRIS.csv.

# Objectives:-
1. Load and preprocess the Iris dataset.
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.
3. Develop a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into their respective species.
4. Evaluate the performance of the model using appropriate metrics.

# Analysis Steps:-
1. Load the Data: Load the Iris dataset from the CSV file and inspect the first few rows to understand its structure.
2. Data Preprocessing: Handle any missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize/standardize the feature values if necessary.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Visualize the distribution of each feature.
- Explore relationships between different features and the target variable.
4. Model Development:
- Split the data into training and testing sets.
- Train a classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.).
- Tune hyperparameters to optimize the model performance.
5. Model Evaluation:
- Evaluate the model on the test set using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix.
- Visualize the results using appropriate plots.

# Files Included:-
IRIS.csv: The Iris dataset.

iris_classification.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data loading, preprocessing, EDA, model development, and evaluation.
README.md: Project documentation.

# Requirements:-
To run this project, you will need the following Python libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

# Results:-
The machine learning model developed in this project achieves high accuracy in classifying Iris flowers into their respective species. The model evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, indicate that the model performs well on the test data. Visualizations such as confusion matrix and feature importance plots provide insights into the model's performance and the significance of different features.
